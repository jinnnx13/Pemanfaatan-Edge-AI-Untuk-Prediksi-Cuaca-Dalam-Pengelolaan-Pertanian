# Pemanfaatan-Edge-AI-Untuk-Prediksi-Cuaca-Dalam-Pengelolaan-Pertanian

# Project Description
This Project Focuses on Implementing Artificial Intelligence with Edge Devices, Primarily Implementing it on Raspberry Pi 3 and using Sensors as an input.

# Problem Statement
1. Indonesia, as an agrarian country, relies heavily on the agricultural sector, especially for rural communities.
2. Agricultural productivity is often disrupted by weather uncertainties such as:
   - Unexpected rainfall,
   - Strong winds, and
   -  Droughts.
3. These weather issues lead to significant losses, including:
   - Reduced harvest yields, and
   - Inefficient use of resources.
     
4. There is a critical need for an accurate and responsive weather prediction system

# Solution Statement
1. The proposed solution leverages Edge AI technology for weather prediction in agriculture.

2. Key capabilities of Edge AI:
   - Processes environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and rainfall locally.
   - Provides real-time weather predictions directly on local devices.
     
3. Applications in agricultural management:

  - Optimizing irrigation:
     - Avoid water wastage by halting irrigation before rain.
     - Ensure sufficient water during hot weather conditions.
  - Enhances decision-making for farmers with timely and accurate weather information.

4. Impact:
   - Improves resource efficiency.
   - Reduces losses caused by unpredictable weather.
   - Boosts agricultural productivity and sustainability.
